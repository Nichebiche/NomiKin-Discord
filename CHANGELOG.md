# Changelog

* Moved core messaging function to [github.com/d3tourrr/NomiKinGo](https://github.com/d3tourrr/NomiKinGo) (other integrations coming eventually!)
* Bot now shows `<name> is typing...` indicator while responding to a message

## v0.0.2

* Bot now shows online in Discord, along with the version of the integration and a link to this repo
* Added version number
* **Nomi** - Updated error message that gets displayed in Discord when a "NoReply" error is sent by the Nomi API. This happens when the Nomi takes too long to respond to a message. The message still shows in the Nomi app, but isn't returned via API.
